                The International Summer School on Robotic Mission Engineering (RoME) is dedicated to advancing the engineering of robotic missions through systematic approaches drawn from Software Engineering. In 2026, RoME proudly celebrates its fourth edition with the support of ACM SIGSOFT.<br>
                Over the course of five days, participants will take part in a dynamic program of presentations, interactive working sessions, and engaging discussions with internationally renowned speakers, who have been a hallmark of RoME since its first edition. This year introduces an exciting new highlight: the very first RoME Robotic Competition, where participants will collaborate to design and execute missions in Turtebots.<br>
                RoME 2026 promises an inspiring environment to learn, collaborate, and innovate at the forefront of robotics research.

In that role, she is Director of the RoboStar centre on Software Engineering for Robotics. She previously held a Royal Society Industry Fellowship, which provided her with the ideal opportunity to understand and contribute to the practice of formal methods working with QinetiQ. Her main scientific achievements have been on the design and justification of sound refinement-based program development and verification techniques. She has covered theoretical and practical integration with industry-strength technology: concurrency, object-orientation, and testing, dealing now with mobile and autonomous robots. She has led the development and justification of refinement theories, notations, and techniques, and tools to cope with control systems. Her work provides support for graphical notations popular with engineers, and for main-stream programming languages. It is distinctive in that it has comprehensive coverage of practical languages, rather than idealised notations. It also supports high degrees of automation to enable usability and scalability. She has chaired the Programme Committee of leading conferences, and been a member of numerous Programme Committees. Currently, she is the Chair of the Formal Methods Europe Board. </p>
